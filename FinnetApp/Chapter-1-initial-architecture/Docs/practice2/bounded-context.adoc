== Module Name

**Passes** (Gym Pass Management)

== Responsibilities

The Passes module is responsible for:

* Registering new gym passes when a contract is signed
* Storing pass data (customer, validity period)
* Retrieving all existing passes
* Marking a pass as expired when its validity period ends

== What This Module Is NOT Responsible For

* Contract preparation or signing — that belongs to the **Contracts** module
* Creating discount offers for expired passes — that belongs to the **Offers** module
* Generating analytical reports — that belongs to the **Reports** module
* Customer identity or authentication

== Data Ownership

The Passes module owns the following data in the `Passes` database schema:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `Id`
| Guid
| Unique pass identifier

| `CustomerId`
| Guid
| Reference to the customer who owns the pass

| `From`
| DateTimeOffset
| Start date of pass validity

| `To`
| DateTimeOffset
| End date of pass validity (updated when expired)
|===

== Integration Points

* **Inbound**: Listens to `ContractSignedEvent` from the Contracts module to create a new pass
* **Outbound**: Publishes `PassRegisteredEvent` after a new pass is created
* **Outbound**: Publishes `PassExpiredEvent` after a pass is marked as expired
